  - title: A Solution that is Long Overdue
    content: |
      Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) is working to eliminate crashes involving disabled vehicles with its new intelligent
      emergency communications feature called the “Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package” or H.E.L.P. for short.

      The H.E.L.P.  solution combines highly visible emergency-based flash rates of the vehicle lighting, and
      digital notifications sent to other vehicles and GPS-based mapping applications. These features deliver
      advanced warning to oncoming traffic -- giving approaching drivers minutes, not just milliseconds, to more
      safely respond to the disabled vehicle.

      ### Enhanced Emergency Lighting
      ESS is increasing visual conspicuity of stationary and disabled vehicles with the addition of a H.E.L.P. Emergency
      mode added to the standard hazard light system. Our H.E.L.P. solution does that by offering:
      - Faster emergency mode flash rates combined with smart intelligence
      - Emergency activation features that deploy automatically upon collision (airbag deployment) and can be activated by other safety trigger events such as a tire blowout or engine failure
      - Manual activation by the driver when the vehicle is stationary and in park

      We are integrating intelligent emergency warnings via digital notifications to supplement the increased visibility
      provided by the enhanced hazard and emergency lighting system.

      When our H.E.L.P. solution is activated manually or upon a vehicle collision (or other triggering event), oncoming
      drivers will receive an advanced warning of a disabled vehicle ahead via their in-car navigation screen.

      We are also raising public awareness of the safety problem and advocating for effective solutions to mitigate this
      issue.

      - ESS is advocating for updates to State Move Over Laws to expand their applicability to passenger vehicles while
      flashing in ESS’ H.E.L.P. Enhanced Emergency Mode.
      - We’re also driving and supporting public safety awareness campaigns to reach automotive safety organizations as
      well as state and federal transportation officials.
