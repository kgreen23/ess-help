**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

HOUSTON, TX — Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) today announced that in the third quarter of 2019, the 
company has documented and validated a new safety case – a previously unidentified root cause of 
preventable, but often fatal, roadway accidents. After identifying this safety case, which results in 
2 to 4 deaths each day in the United States, ESS developed new technology that can be integrated into 
passenger and commercial vehicles to prevent future accidents. ESS has also secured global intellectual 
property for this solution.

ESS has submitted this safety case, which was conducted by an independent analysis firm, to the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), and along with it, a regulatory interpretation request for the solution the company has 
developed.

“The Emergency Safety Solutions team, in its analysis of roadway fatality data published by NHTSA 
and other global government agencies, has identified a safety problem that caused 6,500 to 10,000 
roadway deaths in the United States over the past decade,” said Stephen Powers, Chief Operating 
Officer. “Our team has worked diligently to develop a simple, cost-effective solution to this safety 
case, and we look forward to working with USDOT, NHTSA and auto manufacturers to integrate this 
solution into all new vehicles to prevent the continuation of these unnecessary tragedies.”

_Emergency Safety Solutions will continue to provide updates on this safety case as new information 
becomes available._
