# Clifford Swint Joins Emergency Safety Solutions Board of Directors 
### Houston - Mar 5,2021

Emergency Safety Solutions, Inc. (ESS), creator of the Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package (H.E.L.P.) solution that provides advanced visual and digital warning of disabled vehicles on or near the roadway, has elected Clifford Swint, executive vice president of MFR Securities, Inc., to the ESS Board of Directors. He will lead the board’s newly created Diversity and Community Engagement Committee.

Swint brings with him a broad range of business and leadership experience from various industries, as well as a long track record as a champion for diversity, equality and opportunity. 

Prior to joining MFR, Swint headed the banking team at Blaylock Robert Van, LLC, another leading diversity securities firm. He also held leadership positions RBC Capital Markets and Prudential Insurance. Before his Wall Street career, Swint was a design engineer for Westinghouse Defense and worked on projects such as the fire control systems for the B1 Bomber and F-16 Fighter.

“Cliff is an outstanding business leader and a true pioneer in driving diversity, equality and meaningful community engagement in the financial securities arena,” said David Tucker, founder and CEO of ESS. “As a minority-owned business, we welcome his deep expertise in diversity and equality and the guidance he will bring to ESS as we expand our own efforts in these important areas.”

“In my experience, while having great value-added services and offerings is a solid foundation, companies that effectively engage with their consumers, employees and regulators tend to outperform companies that are less effective in those areas,” said Swint.  

Swint is a Chartered Financial Analyst and holds an Masters of Business Administration from Harvard Business School, a Master of Science degree in computer science from Johns Hopkins University and a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Lafayette College.
