# Emergency Safety Solutions Nationally Certified as a Minority Business Enterprise by Houston Minority Supplier Development Council
### Houston - Dec 14,2020 

Emergency Safety Solutions, Inc. (ESS), creator of the Hazard Enhanced Emergency Lighting Package (H.E.L.P.) solution that provides advanced visual and digital warning of disabled vehicles on or near the roadway to protect their occupants, was recently nationally certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) by the Houston Minority Supplier Development Council (HMSDC).

HMSDC issued the certification on behalf of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, widely considered the “gold standard” by which other minority business certifications are compared. To be certified, a minority business enterprise must be a currently functioning independent business enterprise that is at least 51 percent independently owned, managed and controlled by one or more ethnic minorities. Further, the company must demonstrate the capability to perform a line of business and provide a commercially useful business function according to customs and practices of its industry.

David Tucker, founder and chief executive officer of ESS, is a second-generation Mexican-American entrepreneur with more than 25 years of experience building and divesting start-ups. Tucker incorporated ESS in 2018 to address the growing safety issue of collisions with disabled vehicles along the roadway. A recent study by Impact Research shows nearly 72,000 people in the U.S. each year – one every seven minutes – are involved in a crash involving a disabled vehicle, resulting in nearly 15,000 annual injuries or deaths and nearly $9 billion in societal costs. The study also revealed incidents like this are increasing in frequency at an alarming rate.

“ESS is proud to be certified as a Minority Business Enterprise, as this certification will enhance our efforts to engage with automakers in the U.S. and around the world as we work toward our vision to have our H.E.L.P. safety solution become standard equipment on all passenger vehicles,” said Tucker. “H.E.L.P. is an easy and low-cost solution that will help prevent thousands of injuries and save hundreds of lives every year.”

The ESS H.E.L.P. solution revolutionizes today’s outdated vehicle hazard lighting by transforming it into an intelligent safety communication system that provides both a visual and digital solution to dramatically increase the conspicuity of stationary vehicles. H.E.L.P. uses highly visible, faster hazard light flash patterns along with emergency activation features that deploy automatically upon collision or other trigger events, such as a tire blowout or engine failure. The system can also be manually activated when the vehicle is stationary. 

ESS is also developing solutions that provide oncoming motorists with advance digital notification of these emergencies through their mobile phones and vehicle GPS systems to supplement the visual communication provided when H.E.L.P. is activated.  

ESS is currently working with U.S. and European government automotive safety regulators to confirm its H.E.L.P. solution complies with existing motor vehicle safety standards. The company is hoping to secure such regulatory approval in the near term, which will clear the way for global automakers to begin adopting H.E.L.P. across their vehicle lineups.
