### Comprehensive Portfolio Including 48 Awarded Patents and Open Variation Applications in 46 Countries 

The ESS Global Patent Portfolio consists of 48 awarded foundational patents supplemented by dozens of variation and supplemental patents worldwide. The strength of our patent portfolio protects automakers and customers as a foundation of standardization. Consistency is the key ingredient to effective communication on the road. 

As the patentholder of emergency lighting output driven by original equipment (OE) lighting control systems, ESS can standardize system controls and the lighting output of H.E.L.P. via technical provisions of our license agreements with automakers and their OEM suppliers. Once fully deployed as a standard feature on all vehicles, the H.E.L.P. emergency lighting pattern will be uniform regardless of make and model.
