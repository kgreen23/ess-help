### 49 Awarded and Comprehensive Variation Patent Program in 46 Countries. 

7 awarded foundational patents supplemented by dozens of variation and supplemental patents 
worldwide.  The strength of our patent portfolio protects automakers and customers as a 
foundation of standardization.  Consistency is the key ingredient to effective communication 
on the road.  As the patentholder of emergency lighting output driven by original equipment 
(OE) lighting control systems, ESS can standardize system controls and ￼the lighting output 
of H.E.L.P. via technical provisions of our license agreements with automakers and their 
OEM suppliers.  Once fully deployed as a standard feature on every car, the H.E.L.P. emergency 
lighting pattern you see on the roadway will be the same, irrespective of vehicle make and 
model. When you see a vehicle strobing in H.E.L.P.’s Emergency Mode – whether it be a Toyota, 
BMW, Volvo, Hyundai, GM, Ferrari, or Tesla – you will know (a) it is a passenger vehicle, (b) 
it is stationary, and (c) most importantly, you need to slow down and move over a lane if possible.
