Our mission is to reduce the number of preventable deaths and injuries – globally – from crashes involving disabled vehicles.

We are doing this by selling automotive technology solutions in the production and post-production markets to fill the substantial advanced warning communication gap on the road.

And by advocating for policy changes that work in tandem with our technologies.

## We're On A Mission to Eliminate Crashes Into Disabled Vehicles

Every day, more than 200 preventable crashes involving disabled or stationary vehicles take place across America. Sadly, the numbers continue to climb, with recent studies (2017-2018) showing a nearly 10% annual increase in these types of accidents.
‍
In addition, there’s been a 27% increase in fatalities of pedestrians attending to disabled vehicles -- often Good Samaritans who stop to assist.
‍
Through our experience, industry expertise and tremendous passion for improving road safety, Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) is focused on saving lives by helping to bring an end to these preventable tragedies.

## It’s Time to See Disabled Vehicles in A New Light™

Emergency Safety Solutions is working to eliminate crashes involving disabled vehicles with our new intelligent emergency communications feature called the Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (H.E.L.P).

H.E.L.P. is a regulatory compliant solution that provides two forms of highly effective communication to make your disabled vehicle more visible: (1) highly conspicuous emergency-based lighting output, and (2) digital notifications sent to oncoming vehicles via GPS-based mapping applications.

These features deliver advanced warning to oncoming traffic -- giving approaching drivers minutes, not just milliseconds, to more safely respond to the disabled vehicle.
‍
H.E.L.P. is a key component of ESS’ three-prong strategy to address this previously unidentified safety problem:

### Low Visibility Roadway Emergencies
Every day, people are injured or killed in easily preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles, and the numbers continue to climb. Recent studies (2017-2018) show a nearly 10% annual increase in these types of accidents with a nearly 40% increase in fatalities of pedestrians attending to disabled vehicles. Today, more than 200 preventable crashes involving disabled or stationary vehicles happen every day in the U.S. alone.

Preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles include scenarios like:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, often leading to multiple car pile-ups.
2. A pedestrian is struck while attending to a disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway.
3. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to safely react.

## Inspiring Societal Change

### Chris Smith 
#### ESS Brand Ambassador

Chris Smith is a defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. Smith has also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns. He played college football at Arkansas.

 On the evening of September 11, 2019, Smith and his fiancé, Petara Cordero, experienced a tragic disabled-vehicle crash in the Cleveland metro area while traveling along an expressway. Following the crash, Smith activated his hazard lights and Cordero got out of the vehicle. She was standing next to it awaiting help when she was fatally struck by an oncoming vehicle. 

 In the wake of this tragedy, Smith serves as a brand ambassador for ESS – advocating for our Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package (H.E.L.P.) to be implemented into all new passenger vehicles so he can spare others from the pain and loss he has experienced following Cordero’s death.
