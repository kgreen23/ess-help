### Who is ESS
Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) is focused on saving lives by helping to eliminate hundreds of thousands of preventable accidents involving vehicles that are in an emergency, disabled or parked on the side of the road. Using experience, industry expertise, logic and energy, we develop new strategies and technologies to help prevent future accidents.

### Low Visibility Roadway Emergencies
Every day, people are injured or killed in easily preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles, and the numbers continue to climb. Recent studies (2017-2018) show a nearly 10% annual increase in these types of accidents with a nearly 40% increase in fatalities of pedestrians attending to disabled vehicles. Today, more than 200 preventable crashes involving disabled or stationary vehicles happen every day in the U.S. alone.

Preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles include scenarios like:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, often leading to multiple car pile-ups.
2. A pedestrian is struck while attending to a disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway.
3. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to safely react.

### Inspiring Societal Change
### Chris Smith 
#### ESS Brand Ambassador

Chris Smith is a defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. Smith has also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns. He played college football at Arkansas.

 On the evening of September 11, 2019, Smith and his fiancé, Petara Cordero, experienced a tragic disabled-vehicle crash in the Cleveland metro area while traveling along an expressway. Following the crash, Smith activated his hazard lights and Cordero got out of the vehicle. She was standing next to it awaiting help when she was fatally struck by an oncoming vehicle. 

 In the wake of this tragedy, Smith serves as a brand ambassador for ESS – advocating for our Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package (H.E.L.P.) to be implemented into all new passenger vehicles so he can spare others from the pain and loss he has experienced following Cordero’s death.
