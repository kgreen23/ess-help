# The Problem

Every day, drivers around the world are forced to pull their cars over to the shoulder on 
busy highways and roads. Dealing with flat tires, fender benders, and overheating engines 
should not lead to an injury or loss of life.

A recent study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s fatality data found
that during the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017, between 6,500 and 10,000 people lost their 
lives and more than 500,000 people were injured on roadways in the following scenarios:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, 
including multiple car pile-ups;
1. A pedestrian is struck while attending to disabled vehicle on or adjacent to roadway;
1. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed 
by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when oncoming drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to 
safely react.
