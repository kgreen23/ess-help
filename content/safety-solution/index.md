# The Problem

People are injured or killed in easily preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles every day. Studies show a nearly 10% annual increase in these types of accidents,with a nearly 40% increase in fatalities of pedestrians related to disabled vehicles. Today, 280 preventable crashes involving disabled or stationary vehicles occur every day in the U.S. alone.

Preventable tragedies involving disabled vehicles include scenarios like:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, including multiple car pile-ups.
2. A pedestrian is struck while attending to a disabled vehicle on or adjacent to roadway.
3. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when oncoming drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to 
safely react.

### How ESS Can H.E.L.P.

ESS developed H.E.L.P. (Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package) to protect occupants of disabled vehicles and good Samaritans – providing advanced warning to drivers of potential threats on or near the roadway. H.E.L.P. revolutionizes today’s outdated standard vehicle hazard lighting function, which has not changed in 70 years, to transform it into an intelligent lighting control and safety communication system.

### H.E.L.P. Safety Features 

H.E.L.P. uses highly visible flash patterns to provide instant, unavoidable visibility. This gives oncoming drivers advanced notice of hazards on or near the roadway, and combats driver distraction. It can be deployed manually or automatically upon an emergency event, in conjunction (in cooperation) with other emergency equipment inside the vehicle. H.E.L.P is deployed by pressing the vehicle’s hazard activation button two times, and is intended for use when high visibility is needed or in an emergency. H.E.L.P. is a software-based solution that requires minimal updating to new vehicle safety and lighting control system.
