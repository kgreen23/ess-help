# The Problem

Every day, drivers around the world are forced to pull their cars over to the shoulder on 
busy highways and roads. Dealing with flat tires, fender benders, and overheating engines 
should not lead to an injury or loss of life.

A recent study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s fatality data found
that during the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017, up to 10,000 people lost their 
lives and more than 500,000 people were injured on roadways in the following scenarios:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, 
including multiple car pile-ups;
1. A pedestrian is struck while attending to disabled vehicle on or adjacent to roadway;
1. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed 
by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when oncoming drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to 
safely react.

### How ESS Can H.E.L.P.

ESS’s globally patented H.E.L.P. safety feature is a low-cost technology designed to mitigate the 
likelihood of moving vehicles striking stationary, disabled vehicles. The Hazard Enhanced 
Lighting Package (H.E.L.P.) adds intelligence and enhanced functions to existing vehicle 
lighting control systems, lights, and switchgear to provide the best safety-cost-benefit 
profile of any original equipment vehicle feature since the advent of the seat belt. The 
integration of H.E.L.P. is easily deployed via over-the-air (OTA) software or via OEM-level 
manual software updates to the body control module (BCM) of any LED-equipped passenger vehicle.

### H.E.L.P. Safety Features 

H.E.L.P. is an original equipment, emergency communication technology designed to increase the 
visual and digital conspicuity of stationary, disabled vehicles and motorists on the roadway. 
Thanks to recent advances in automotive lighting and vehicle communication systems, HELP-Enabled 
vehicles are equipped with enhanced hazard / emergency communication functions which append to 
standard 1.5Hz to 2.0Hz hazard lighting functionality.  When activated, H.E.L.P. provides 
emergency "strobing" of the vehicle’s hazard lights and side markers at an accelerated rate of 
4.0Hz to 6.0Hz; as well as digital messaging via integration with V2V and V2X platforms to provide 
GPS and emergency response communication systems with advanced notification of a stationary, 
disabled vehicle on or near the roadway. High flash rate emergency lighting is a time-tested technique 
to increase roadway safety.  We have been protecting tow truck drivers, roadway construction 
personnel, and emergency responders for decades.  Now is the time to extend this protection 
to the other 99% of roadway users – mothers, fathers, and children.  H.E.L.P.'s emergency lighting pattern 
has been developed and optimized to make it (a) effective in eliciting driver response, (b) 
clearly distinct from emergency responder flash patterns, and (c) compliant with US federal 
motor vehicle standards (FMVSS 108) and state traffic laws.
 
H.E.L.P.'s emergency communication mode activates automatically upon collision to prevent or 
mitigate the severity of secondary collisions and multiple car pileups.  It can also be 
activated manually as an additional mode (second button press) in the hazard light button 
when your vehicle is completely at rest with the transmission in park.  Think of it as "high 
beams" for your hazard light system for use in stationary emergency situations.
