ESS developed H.E.L.P. (Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package) to protect 
occupants of disabled vehicles and good Samaritans who assist them – 
providing more advance warning to drivers of potential threats on or 
near the roadway. H.E.L.P. is a regulatory compliant safety feature that revolutionizes today’s outdated standard 
vehicle hazard lighting function, which dates back to 1951, by 
transforming it into an intelligent safety communication system. 
H.E.L.P. uses highly visible hazard light flash patterns to provide 
instant, greatly enhanced visibility of disabled or stopped vehicles 
on the road or roadside – giving drivers of oncoming vehicles more 
advance notice of these hazards. It is intended for use when high 
visibility is needed or in an emergency.
