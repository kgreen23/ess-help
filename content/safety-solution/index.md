# The Problem

Every day, drivers around the world are forced to pull their cars over to the shoulder on 
busy highways and roads. Dealing with flat tires, fender benders, and overheating engines 
should not lead to an injury or loss of life.

A recent study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s fatality data found
that during the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017, between 6,500 and 10,000 people lost their 
lives and more than 500,000 people were injured on roadways in the following scenarios:

1. A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, 
including multiple car pile-ups;
1. A pedestrian is struck while attending to disabled vehicle on or adjacent to roadway;
1. A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed 
by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.

These accidents occur when oncoming drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to 
safely react.

### How ESS Can H.E.L.P.

ESS’s H.E.L.P. safety feature is a globally patented low-cost technology designed for emergency 
situations in which one moving vehicle strikes one or more non-moving, disabled vehicles. This Hazard Enhanced Lighting Package
utilizes existing vehicle wiring harnessing and componentry, thus H.E.L.P. is an ideal 
fit into all OEM Vehicle Manufacturers and offers the adopting vehicle manufacturer the best 
safety-cost-benefit ratio of any original equipment vehicle feature since the advent of the 
seat belt. Surprisingly enough, the integration of the H.E.L.P. safety feature into passenger 
vehicles can be done easily using over-the-air (OTA) software or manual updates to the body 
control module (BCM) or electronic control unit (ECU) of each passenger vehicle.

### H.E.L.P. Safety Features 

The H.E.L.P. Safety Solution is a lighting technology specifically designed to increase the visual 
conspicuity of distressed or disabled vehicles and motorist. Thanks to the development in 
lighting, specifically in LED technology, vehicles with H.E.L.P. are equipped an enhanced hazard 
lighting function that will allow the vehicle to simultaneously strobe at a speed of 5 Hz rather 
than at the current frequency of between 1-2 Hz. Science has proven time and time again that this increase 
in flash rate frequency, increases driver reaction timing and therefore, decreases the likelihood 
of secondary collisions and multi-car pile up accidents. 

Also, the moment a motorist gets into an accident where the air bags deploy, H.E.L.P. technology 
will also immediately engage and caused the vehicle to strobe at the increased flash rate. This 
will provide each motorist and all passengers involved increased assurance that they will be seen 
aided by first responders quicker than ever before. H.E.L.P. technology can also be activated by 
pressing the in-vehicle hazard button twice as seen in this video.
