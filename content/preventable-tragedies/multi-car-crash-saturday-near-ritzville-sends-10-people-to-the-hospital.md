title: "Multi-car crash Saturday near Ritzville sends 10 people to the hospital"

A multi-car collision near Ritzville on Interstate 90 sent 10 people to the hospital Saturday afternoon.

Five cars rear-ended each other just after 2 p.m. Saturday 20 miles west of Ritzville, according to the Washington State Patrol. The crash was due to blowing dust over the road, Trooper Jeff Sevigney tweeted. There were no serious injuries reported, although 10 people were sent to the hospital to receive medical care, Sevigney said.

A white minivan carrying a couple and their four children ages 2 to 11 first struck a semitruck from behind, which caused a series of additional collisions. Another semitruck hit the first, followed by an SUV then running into the two trucks.

All four vehicles came to a stop on the right shoulder of I90. The fifth car, also an SUV, hit the fourth car and came to rest of the left side of the road.

The two semitruck drivers were uninjured. The driver of the SUV was not injured, but taken to a hospital as a precaution. Everyone else received injuries and were transported to a nearby hospital. The driver of the fourth car was taken to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane. Everyone involved was wearing their seat belt.
