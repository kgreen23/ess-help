SAINT BERNARD, Ohio â€”
A pedestrian was struck and killed on I-75 late Christmas Eve night, and now police are searching for the driver.

According to the St. Bernard Police Department, just before 11:30 p.m., a man was driving a 2002 Ford Explorer when it became disabled on I-75 south at mile marker 6.7. A good Samaritan stopped two lanes over from the Ford Explorer and came over to ask the man if he needed any assistance.The driver of the Ford Explorer got out of his car and was approaching the other car when an unknown black SUV came between both cars and hit him, then went right and struck the good Samaritan's car.

The driver of the black SUV did not stop and continued driving south on I-75. St. Bernard police said they do not have any leads yet.

Ohio State Highway Patrol later identified the victim as Gaspar Lopez Rodriguez, 35.

I-75 remained shut down through the overnight hours as authorities continued to investigate and eventually reopened at 3:30 Christmas morning.
