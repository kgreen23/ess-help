A 30-year-old Lombard woman died and a 9-year-old child was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries Tuesday after their car was struck by a semitrailer truck on Interstate 88 in Lisle.

Illinois State Police said the unidentified woman was driving a 2009 Honda Accord in the far left lane of westbound I-88 around 10:59 a.m. when she lost control near the Route 53 exit. The car hit the concrete median and then went back into traffic and was struck by the semitrailer truck.
