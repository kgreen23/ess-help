title: "Southern Indiana man killed after his stranded car was hit by semi on I-65, police say"

A Henryville, Indiana, man was killed Thursday night after a semitruck hit his stranded vehicle on Interstate 65 South in Clark County, according to police.

Cody William Whitehead, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, which was reported shortly after 11 p.m. Thursday near mile marker 7 of I-65 South, according to Indiana State Police.

Investigators believe Whitehead moved his Buick to the side of the interstate in an emergency lane after it ran out of gas.

After putting his emergency lights on and calling for assistance, Whitehead was waiting inside his car when a semitruck crossed over the fog line for an unknown reason and hit Whitehead's car, pushing it into the guardrail on the side of I-65 South, state police said.
The Buick came to a rest partially in the right lane of the interstate and then was hit by another vehicle and a second tractor-trailer, with both vehicle unable to avoid the crash, according to state police.

No other drivers were injured, and Indiana State Police said alcohol and drugs are not suspected factors in the crash, though blood results are pending.

No citations or charges have been filed, police said, but an investigation is ongoing.
