Troopers with the Louisiana State Police are requesting the publicâ€™s help to identify vehicles and drivers involved in a fatal hit-and-run crash.

The crash happened on October 29 at about 9:20 p.m. in West Baton Rouge Parish, and left a Baton Rouge woman dead.Theresa Matherne, 57, had stopped to help a driver who had been involved in another crash, troopers say. She was trying to cross U.S. 190 near La. 415 when she was hit by a Honda Accord. The car is described as gold, tan or silver, and a 2008 to 2012 model year, troopers say. Troopers now know Matherne was struck as she entered the inside lane of US Hwy 190 eastbound.

After hitting Matherne, the driver of the car pulled off the highway onto the shoulder, near a church. The driver got out, pulled off some damaged vehicle parts, and then fled the scene, troopers say.

The light colored 2008-2012 Honda Accord suspect vehicle will have front passenger side damage to the bumper, hood, headlight assembly, and wheel well. This vehicle may also have windshield damage, troopers say.

After being struck by the above described Honda, Matherne was again struck, this time by a 2013-2016 Chevrolet Malibu. This vehicle has possibly sustained front bumper and undercarriage damage as a result of the collision, troopers say.

Here are the pictures troopers have, which were pulled from surveillance cameras in the area:
