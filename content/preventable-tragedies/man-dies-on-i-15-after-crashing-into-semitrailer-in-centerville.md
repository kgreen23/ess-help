title: "Man dies on I-15 after crashing into semitrailer in Centerville"
---
CENTERVILLE — A 72-year-old man driving on I-15 in Centerville died after colliding with a semitrailer that had stopped for another crash Wednesday.

The wreck occurred at about 11:30 a.m. when a driver traveling in the center lane attempted to abruptly cross over and exit on Parrish Lane, the Department of Public Safety said in a news release.

“They crossed the right lane into the gore area for the off-ramp striking the attenuator,” the news release says. “The vehicle came to a rest in the right travel lane of the main-flow portion of the interstate.”

A truck driver witnessed the accident and stopped in the lane in an attempt to shield the disabled vehicle, but a 1994 Nissan Sentra crashed into the semitrailer at full speed for an unknown reason, according to the Department of Public Safety.

The 72-year-old driver was the sole occupant of the Sentra and did not survive the crash, authorities said.
