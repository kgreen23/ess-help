TRUMBULL — The driver of a local tow truck was hit and killed in a major crash Wednesday afternoon that shut down a stretch of the Merritt Parkway for hours.

Troopers from the Connecticut State Police Troop G barrack in Bridgeport responded to Route 15 south in the area of Exit 47 for a reported crash around 4:45 p.m., according to Trooper First Class Christine Jeltema.

First responders on scene indicated over dispatch broadcasts that there were three “walking wounded” and one “DOA.”

Corey John Iodice, 58, of Magnolia Avenue in Seffner, Fla., was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a state police accident report.
The website for IFT said Iodice had more than 30 years of “towing and heavy recovery expertise.”

He was there to tow the disabled vehicle of a 25-year-old Bridgeport man.
A third vehicle on scene was driven by a friend of the Bridgeport man, who he called for a ride.

While Iodice was loading the disabled vehicle onto the tow truck, the report said, a 46-year-old Weston man driving in the right lane, “lost control for unknown reasons,” and hit the vehicles of the two Bridgeport men.

The Weston man’s vehicle then continued “up the bed” of the tow truck and hit Iodice, “who was standing adjacent to the flat bed portion of the tow truck,” the state police report said.

The report said the Weston man’s vehicle then rolled on its roof and came to a rest on the right shoulder of the highway.

Medics pronounced Iodice dead at the crash site, state police said.
