UPDATE: One person has died after a four-vehicle crash on I-75 SB at the Benchwood exit on Sunday morning.

Officers on the scene say that the crash happened not long after three Good Samaritans saw a car parked on the side of the road and pulled over to offer assistance. When Jerome Dominic Golston, 29, Sarenthia Traylor, 53, and Traylor's passenger Cesere C. Traylor, 28, saw that the vehicle was abandoned, they called for a tow truck. While they waited, a fourth car, driven by Mark S. Frankenberg drove into the shoulder and hit the three parked cars, causing massive damage.

While originally officers on the scene reported that two women had died, only one person died after the crash.

Sarenthia Traylor sustained life-threatening injuries in the crash, and died while being transported to Miami Valley Hospital. Cesere Traylor was critically injured and transported to Miami Valley Hospital where she is reportedly in serious condition. Frankenberg and Golston were both taken to Miami Valley Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
