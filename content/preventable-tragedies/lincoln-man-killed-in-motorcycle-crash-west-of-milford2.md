MILFORD, Neb. (AP) â€” A Lincoln man died in a motorcycle crash near Milford in southeastern Nebraska last week, authorities said.

The crash happened Wednesday night on U.S. Highway 6 just west of Milford, killing 20-year-old Luke Anderson.

Seward County Sheriff Mike Vance said Anderson was on a motorcycle headed west on the highway when he hit a disabled car on the shoulder of the roadway. Anderson died at the scene. Investigators said no one was in the car at the time of the crash.
