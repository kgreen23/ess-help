ST. LOUIS COUNTY â€” A Kirkwood woman standing on the shoulder of Interstate 44 after a vehicle crash was killed Tuesday when a tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck her and another person.

The incident that killed 30-year-old Heather N. Baker occurred about 10:40 a.m. Tuesday.

The Missouri Highway Patrol said she was struck on westbound I-44, east of Highway 109.

Another woman, 28-year-old Jessie M. Christopher of Fenton, was also struck by the truck. She suffered moderate injuries, the patrol said.

The truck driver, Tony R. Pope, was seriously hurt in the crash. Pope, 60, is from Akins, Alabama.

Baker and Christopher were on the highway because their 2016 Jeep Wrangler was disabled in an earlier crash involving a 2018 Freightliner truck. The Jeep and Freightliner were both parked on the shoulder, authorities said.

A westbound International tractor-trailer driven by Pope hit the back of a 2016 Honda CRV, causing Pope's truck to jackknife and go off the highway to the right. He then struck the Jeep and the two women, police said.

Pope's truck also hit the rig that was parked on the shoulder.

Baker died at the scene. Christopher and Pope were taken to Mercy Hospital St. Louis in Creve Coeur. The woman driving the Honda that was hit from behind was not injured, police said.
