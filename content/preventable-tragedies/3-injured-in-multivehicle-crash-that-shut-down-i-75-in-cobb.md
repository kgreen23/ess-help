Three people were injured Monday evening in a four-vehicle crash that shut down the southbound lanes of I-75 in Marietta for more than two hours, authorities said.

The chain-reaction wreck happened about 8:45 p.m. just south of Canton Road, Marietta police spokesman Officer Chuck McPhilamy said.

According to investigators, a 29-year-old Marietta woman was traveling south near the Canton Road Connector when her Nissan Altima broke down on the interstate. A Tesla Model S carrying three people had slowed down for the disabled vehicle when it was struck from behind by a Mercury Sprinter van driven by a 22-year-old from Kennesaw, authorities said. The van also crashed into the back of the Nissan.The impact of the collision forced the Tesla into the left lanes of the interstate, where the car was struck by a Toyota Corolla before coming to a stop against the median wall, investigators said. The Tesla’s driver and front-seat passenger, identified Tuesday as 31-year-old Ali Kamran of Macon and Muhamed Khan of Acworth, were taken to Wellstar Kennestone Hospital with minor injuries. The back seat passenger, identified as Ans Rana of Acworth, suffered life-threatening injuries in the crash, police said.The wrecks snarled southbound traffic for more than two hours as police shut down the interstate to investigate. All lanes were reopened about 11 p.m. Anyone with information about Monday’s crash is asked to call Marietta police at 770-794-5352.
