MARRERO, La. (WDSU) â€” Two Good Samaritans who stopped to render aid to a driver stranded after a single vehicle crash were both hit and killed by a passing vehicle Saturday night.

Louisiana State Police say around 9:40 p.m., troopers responded to the crash on the Westbank Expressway eastbound near the intersection of MacArthur Avenue in Jefferson Parish.

The initial investigation by troopers shows there was a single-vehicle crash, which resulted in that vehicle being disabled in the roadway.

Troopers say several motorists stopped to render aid, who then became pedestrians in the roadway. At the same time, the LSP said a 2001 Ford Expedition was traveling eastbound, and for reasons unknown, struck the pedestrians, resulting in severe injuries.

The LSP says 53-year-old Ruby Roman, of Harvey, along with another pedestrian, were both pronounced dead on the scene as a result of injuries sustained during the crash.

The driver of the Expedition was properly restrained and uninjured, police said. Impairment on the driver of the Expedition is not suspected.

The crash remains under investigation.
