CENTRE COUNTY, Pa. (WTAJ) — A crash between two tractor-trailers after one tipped over left a driver dead and I-80 east closed for almost 12 hours Monday night.

According to the report, the first truck entered I-80 from I-99 and while making the turn, the load shifted in his trailer and caused the truck to overturn onto I-80.

The driver of the second truck, 35-year-old Jose Chirinos Ortega of Bay Shore, NY, was driving his tractor-trailer east on I-80 and hit the overturned truck. The impact caused Ortega to be thrown from his truck, suffering fatal injuries.

Bellefonte EMS, Mount Nittany Paramedic, Bellefonte Fire Dept., PennDOT, Centre County EMA, Centre County Coroner’s Office, and Eagle Towing all assisted at the scene.
