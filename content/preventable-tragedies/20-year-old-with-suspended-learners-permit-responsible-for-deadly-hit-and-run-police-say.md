HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – A man driving with a suspended learner’s permit was arrested after a year-long investigation into a hit-and-run on Interstate 95.

The victim, an Uber driver, was a good Samaritan who had stopped to help a disabled vehicle.

According to Florida Highway Patrol investigators, it was Sebastian Michel Jean-Baptiste, now 21, who was behind the wheel of a 2019 Toyota Camry when Pierre Michel Fortin was struck at approximately 2:06 a.m. on Oct. 31, 2019.

Jean-Baptiste was arrested Friday, almost exactly a year after the crash.

The crash happened on northbound I-95 about 300 feet south of the State Road 824 (Pembroke Road) overpass, according to FHP.

Investigators said Fortin had stopped his car after he saw that a Chrysler PT Cruiser was smashed into a concrete median barrier. After helping the motorist, Fortin was returning to his vehicle, but as he crossed the highway a vehicle hit him and kept going.
