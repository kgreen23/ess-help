title: "Amazon truck accident kills two women in Houston"
---
The Harris County Sheriffâ€™s Office said the incident happened around 1:30 a.m. on a rain-slicked North Freeway in Houston.
It started when an SUV occupied by a man, a woman, and two small children, ages 1 and 3, pulled over with a flat tire. A second car ran into the SUV. A woman from each vehicle stood outside along the freeway. Subsequently, a pickup truck crashed into a wall, and the driver of a fourth vehicle stopped to help.
While the four vehicles were stopped at the site, an Amazon semi-tractor-trailer careened into all of them.
The two women were tragically killed in the crash.

The man from the fourth vehicle had to jump off a bridge to avoid being hit by the Amazon truck. He reportedly fell 10 to 15 feet and was injured.
