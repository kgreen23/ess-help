A four year-old girl was killed and her twin sister was hospitalized after their mother pulled over by the side of the road to let them pee. The unidentified youngsters were hit by two separate cars along the Interstate 70 near Hagerstown, Maryland, around 7:30pm Monday evening. Investigators say the family was traveling westbound on the road when they pulled onto its right shoulder to allow the two girls and their teenage cousin to relieve themselves. Their mom got out of the car passenger side and walked around towards the rear of the car. The teenage boy is then said to have left the back seat, and run across two lanes of the freeway to its center median. His young twin cousins exited and ran across the road towards him moments later. Both were struck by separate oncoming vehicles. One of the twins was rushed to Meritus Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, WUSA reported. Her sibling was taken by helicopter to Johns Hopkins Children’s Hospital in Baltimore. An update on her condition has not yet been released.
Maryland State Police said no charges have been filed in connection to the tragedy. The I-70’s westbound lanes were closed for three hours following Monday’s accident. An investigation into the smash continues.
