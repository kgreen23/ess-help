ORANGE COUNTY â€” The Texas Department of Public Safety is trying to identify a driver who struck a disabled tractor trailer on I-10 in Orange County, then crossed all lanes of traffic before striking the concrete barrier, overturning and bursting into flames.

The preliminary investigation indicates that at about 9:10 p.m. Monday, a 2016 Peterbilt commercial vehicle was disabled on the westbound improved shoulder near mile marker 876. The driver of a 2016 Hyundai Sonata was traveling westbound, failed to control speed, and struck the back of the Peterbilt. Due to the force of the crash, the Hyundai crossed all lanes of traffic and struck the concrete barrier, overturned and burst into flames.

The driver of the commercial vehicle was not injured and is identified as Peter Giraudin, 64, from Stony Point, New York.

The driver of the Hyundai has not been identified due to the severe burns from the crash.
