DAYTON, OH, (April 05, 2020) - Tasha Watkins was tragically struck and killed in a hit-and-run crash on the evening of Sunday, April 5th in Dayton.
The multi-vehicle accident occurred on North Gettysburg Avenue when a car rear-ended another vehicle. That car was pushed across the median, where it collided with a minivan, before driving off the left side of the road. The minivan was pushed into the next lane, where it struck a car traveling southbound.

The car that started the chain reaction crash struck a pole and fled the scene, abandoning the vehicle about a block away from the incident. Watkins, 35, was rushed to Miami Valley Hospital, where she died. 

The Dayton Police Department is actively pursuing the hit-and-run driver.
