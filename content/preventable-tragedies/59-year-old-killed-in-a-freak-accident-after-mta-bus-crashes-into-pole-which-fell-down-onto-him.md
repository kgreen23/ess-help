A 59-year-old pedestrian lost his life after an MTA bus caused an unexpected mishap that knocked him out and caused serious injury.

Lance Margolin’s family was thrown into an emotional state after an MTA bus knocked off a street pole that ended on top of him. Margolin was said to be returning from his wife’s party. 

In Brooklyn, New York, the incident occurred when the MTA bus was trying to navigate a faulty vehicle on the road. The side mirror had hit the pole, and the impact crushed the pole.The unfortunate moment happened when Margolin, his wife Balestire, and some of their friends walked back home after attending her birthday party.

Margolin’s friend Joanne recalled that she and another friend were walking ahead of Balestire and her husband when the sound of the crashing pole sent everyone running for safety.At a point, she turned and noticed that one of the pair was on the floor. Joanne noted that she was terrified that Balestire had been struck to find out that Margolin had been the victim.Balestire has since shared that she and her family are finding it hard to process the tragic passing of their loved ones, but they decided to hold on to the good memories about him. 

A community in Michigan recorded a similar unfortunate occurrence after it was reported that a high school assistant principal died on his way back from vacation with his family.
