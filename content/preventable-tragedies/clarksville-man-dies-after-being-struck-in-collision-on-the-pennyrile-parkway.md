A man was pronounced dead at around 10:10 p.m. Saturday after being struck by a vehicle on the Pennyrile Parkway, according to a Kentucky State Police press release.

The release states Shoan Mitchell Jr., 21, Clarksville, was driving north on the Pennyrile near mile marker 17 when, for an unknown reason, Mitchell’s car became disabled in the median of the parkway.

Mitchell reportedly left the vehicle and crossed both northbound lanes to speak with an individual who was parked on the northbound shoulder of the parkway, the release said.

Mitchell then turned and began to cross both lanes back to his vehicle, but was struck by a vehicle driven by Nicholas Starr, 37, Madisonville.Starr exited the vehicle to check on Mitchell when his vehicle was struck by Haley Keenan, 26, Evansville, Indiana, according to the release.

Mitchell was pronounced dead at the scene by the Christian County Coroner’s Office, while neither Starr nor Keenan reported any injuries.

KSP is continuing to investigate the accident, the release added.
