Two people died in a crash involving four cars on Interstate 95 on Wednesday night near Christiana, according to Delaware State Police. 

Both had been trying to help a driver who had lost control and crashed on the interstate, setting off a chain of crashes spanning both the southbound and northbound lanes of I-95, according to Delaware State Police. 

Around 10:40 p.m., a 2000 Honda Civic driven by a 22-year-old man of North East, Maryland was driving northbound on I-95 in the left center lane, just north of the Churchman's Road overpass. 

A car not involved in the crash merged from the right center lane to the left center lane, causing the driver of the Civic to lose control and hit a concrete barrier. 

The Civic came to a stop in the northbound left lane of I-95. 

Then, a 29-year-old man, also of North East, pulled over and got out of his car to check on the driver of the Civic. At the same time, a 2020 Kia Stinger driven by a 20-year-old Wilmington man veered into the left shoulder to avoid hitting the stopped Civic. The Stinger ended up side swiping the Civic and hitting the 29-year-old man standing on the shoulder. 

After being hit, the 29-year-old pedestrian landed in the left southbound lane of I-95, where he was hit by a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro driven by a 19-year-old Newark resident. 

The 29-year-old pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.  

Meanwhile, the Stinger continued traveling out of control until it hit the back of a 2018 Ford Focus driven by a 25-year-old female of Delmar who had slowed down to assist the disabled motorist.This caused the Focus to be pushed forward and hit the concrete barrier on the left shoulder. 

The driver of the Ford Focus was transported to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. 

The driver and passenger of the Civic were not injured. The driver and passenger of the Kia Stinger were transported for minor injuries. The driver of the Chevrolet Camaro was not injured. The names of both the pedestrian and driver of the Focus are being withheld until next of kin can be notified. 

The collision shut down the two left lanes of I-95 southbound and the three right lanes of I-95 northbound.
