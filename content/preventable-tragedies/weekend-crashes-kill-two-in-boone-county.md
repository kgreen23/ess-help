title: "Weekend Crashes Kill Two in Boone County"
---
Two men died in separate crashes in Boone County over the weekend.

The first happened at around 1 a.m. on Saturday after one vehicle broke down on I-71/75, and was then struck by a different vehicle and pushed it through a concrete barrier to the other side of the interstate where it was struck again by a tractor-trailer.

A passenger in the broken-down vehicle, Franklin A. Morales Temaj, 26, of Cincinnati was killed. The car was driven by Ingrid Mendez, 26, of Cincinnati. The pair had been traveling northbound on I-71/75 when it stalled due to mechanical issues.

That car was originally struck by a vehicle driven by Brandon Hess, 37, of Campbellsville, Ky., who suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The tractor-trailer, which was headed southbound at the time, was driven by Joshua Ball, 32, of Monroe, Mich.

The crash is under investigation.
