State police responded around 10:05 p.m. to a three-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of I-664, south of Terminal Avenue in Newport News.

State police spokesperson Sgt.

Newton, inside the stalled BMW.

Smith attempted to wave vehicles down to slow down but a 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander exiting the tunnel hit the BMW from behind.

The BMW was pushed into a jersey wall and then landed in the middle travel lane. 

That's when it was hit again by a 2005 Toyota Avalon.

Newton was not wearing her seatbelt when the BMW was hit by both the SUV and the car. She died at the scene.

The other drivers of the two vehicles had injuries not considered life-threatening.

Newton's family has been notified.

The investigation is ongoing, pending the consultation of the Newport News City Commonwealth Attorney's Office, Anaya said.
