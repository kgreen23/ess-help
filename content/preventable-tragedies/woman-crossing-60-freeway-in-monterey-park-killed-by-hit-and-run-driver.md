title: "Woman crossing 60 Freeway in Monterey Park killed by hit-and-run driver"
---
A Long Beach woman died early Wednesday, April 28, after she left her disabled car and was struck while running across the 60 Freeway in Monterey Park, authorities said.

The driver who hit her fled the scene.

The California Highway Patrol identified the woman as 18-year-old Crystal Ruby Soto.

Soto was driving a Honda Accord on the westbound 60 Freeway, east of Markland Drive, shortly after 2 a.m. when she lost control of the car, veered left and hit the center divider, CHP Officer Brandon Partida said in a statement.

The Honda became disabled in the No. 1 lane. He said Soto and her three teenage passengers left the car and ran across the lanes toward the freeway shoulder. A vehicle hit Soto then left.

As Good Samaritans stopped to help, Partida said Soto’s passengers left before the CHP arrived.

The CHP didn’t have a description of the suspect or the vehicle that hit Soto.

Because of the fatal hit-and-run, the CHP issued a SigAlert for four lanes of the westbound 60 Freeway at 2:35 a.m. The lanes reopened two hours and 41 minutes later.

The CHP asked that anyone with information about the hit-and-run is asked to call the East LA CHP office at 323-980-4600.
