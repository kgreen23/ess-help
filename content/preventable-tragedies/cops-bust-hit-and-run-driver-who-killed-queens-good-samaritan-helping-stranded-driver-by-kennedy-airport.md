title: "Cops bust hit-and-run driver who killed Queens good Samaritan helping stranded driver by Kennedy Airport"

A hit-and-run driver who killed a big-hearted Long Island man as he tried to help a motorist stranded on the side of the road outside Kennedy Airport was formally charged with criminally negligent homicide Thursday, authorities said.

Kevin Drawhorne, 27, of Jamaica, Queens, is accused of hitting and killing Michael Agurkis, 51, and injuring another driver who had broken down near the airport Jan. 29, the Queens District Attorney’s Office said.Drawhorne pleaded not guilty to the charges at arraignment Thursday in Queens Supreme Court, and remained jailed Thursday night on $75,000 bail.Agurkis, of East Atlantic Beach, L.I., pulled over on the eastbound side of Nassau Expressway near North Hangar Road in Springfield Gardens about 8:20 p.m. when he saw a stalled Dodge Caravan, cops said.As he and the 53-year-old Dodge Caravan owner stood in front of the vehicle trying to figure out what was wrong with the engine, Drawhorne — driving at a speed of 70 mph — slammed his 2012 Ford E350 van into the minivan and the two men, cops said.Agurkis was struck square in the chest. Medics rushed him to Jamaica Hospital, but he couldn’t be saved.The owner of the Dodge Caravan survived the crash with minor injuries.

Instead of stopping to tend to the victims or calling police, Drawhorne fled the scene, authorities said. Cops later found the wrecked Ford van abandoned, authorities said.“A man who was doing a good deed — helping another driver with car trouble — was senselessly killed by another motorist allegedly driving at a high rate of speed,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a statement.

“He did not call 911. He did not stop to help. This kind of behavior is not only callous, but also criminal and the defendant now faces serious charges.”

Besides the criminally negligent homicide charge, Drawhorne is charged with leaving the scene of an accident, driving without a license, and driving in excess of the maximum speed limit. If convicted, Drawhorne faces up to seven years in prison, authorities said.

“The simplicity of doing the right thing, if more people did that the world would be a better place,” Amanda Agurkis, 27, the dead man’s daughter, tearfully told the Daily News after the crash. “Please let’s just try to bring justice to his memory.”
