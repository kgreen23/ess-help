title: "GoFundMe page created for good Samaritan killed on I-95"
---
A Richmond Hill man, who police say was hit by a car and killed Sunday morning on Interstate 95 while trying to help another driver, has left behind a wife and three young children.

A GoFundMe page has been created to help the family of Timothy Ebert, a 34-year-old air traffic controller at Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, who was on his way to work when he got out to help a motorist near the intersection of I-95 and I-16.

Ebert, an E-7 Marine veteran, was "one of the kindest people we have ever met. We are here to take care of his family the way that he has taken care of us," wrote the creator of the GoFundMe page, which had raised almost all of its $45,000 goal by Tuesday afternoon. The GoFundMe page can be found here.

According to his obituary, Ebert " loved to spend time exploring the outdoors and playing games with his family. He enjoyed fishing, golf, watching his children play sports, playing Magic the Gathering and Legend of Zelda, cooking, eating spicy food and pickled sausages with his daughter, and frequenting his favorite restaurant, Chipotle."

He is survived by his wife of 7 years, Lindsay Ebert; daughter, Tinley (6); and sons, Bryce (12) and Brayden (9). After graduating high school, he went on to serve his country in the U.S. Marine Corps for over 13 years. He served a tour in Iraq (August 2008 - March 2009) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and a tour in Kuwait (March 2016- October 2016) in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Ebert was an E7 Gunnery Sergeant when he received an honorable discharge in 2017. He went on to join the Federal Aviation Administration as an Air Traffic Controller.

Memorial services will be held Saturday, August 15, at 11 a.m. at Oak Hill Cemetery in Richmond Hill with military honors.
