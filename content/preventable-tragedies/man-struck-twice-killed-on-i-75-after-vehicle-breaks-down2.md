BERLIN TOWNSHIP - Authorities say a Garden City man whose car broke down on I-75 was hit by two vehicles and killed as he tried to cross the freeway. 

The incident happened around 10:30 p.m. Thursday along northbound I-75 just south of Swan Creek Road in Berlin Township. The Monroe County Sheriff's Department says the 64-year-old victim left his disabled vehicle along the roadway and was walking across the freeway when he was struck by a Ford Explorer that was traveling in the center lane.
