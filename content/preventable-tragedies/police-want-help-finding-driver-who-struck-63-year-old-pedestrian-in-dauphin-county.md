A 63-year-old tractor-trailer driver was injured last month when a car hit him while he was walking back to his truck early one morning in Swatara Township, police said.

Swatara Township police said the man was walking on the shoulder of Grayson Road around 12:31 a.m. on May 21 when he was hit by a champagne-colored Honda headed westbound.

The driver left the scene without checking on the victim, but he was able to call for help on his own.
He received treatment at a local hospital and is recovering from his injuries.

The Honda is missing housing from its passenger-side mirror, as well as a section of fender from in front of the passenger-side front tire.
