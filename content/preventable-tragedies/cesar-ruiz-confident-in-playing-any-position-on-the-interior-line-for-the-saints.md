title: "Cesar Ruiz confident in playing any position on the interior line for the Saints"

Michigan's Cesar Ruiz is now with the New Orleans Saints, as he was taken 24th overall on the first night of the NFL draft. The offensive lineman shared an extremely emotional moment with his family shortly after he was drafted, thinking of his father immediately. The other part was was the excitement and release from realizing that he's now a professional in the NFL.

"I dedicate my whole journey to him," Ruiz said on Thursday night.

Tragically, Ruiz lost his father at the age of eight years old. His father, who was also named Cesar, was hit by a car on the side of a South New Jersey highway after he pulled over to help another drive fix a flat tire. Ruiz started playing football at the age of 10 to cope with the loss.

Ruiz didn't think he was going to be the 24th pick originally, but got the call from the Saints with about two minutes left on the clock. Ultimately, he got the call from Jeff Ireland and Sean Payton. When asked, Ruiz was confident in saying that he could play any position across the interior line, pointing out that that's where his versatility comes into play.
