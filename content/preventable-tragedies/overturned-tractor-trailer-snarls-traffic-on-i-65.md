NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) â€” An overturned tractor trailer had lanes of I-65NB shut down between Portland and Mitchellville in Robertson County. It's since reopened, but drivers should expect heavy traffic throughout the morning.Tennessee Highway Patrol says the tractor-trailer was traveling southbound when it hit a vacant parked car on the shoulder, went across the median and into the northbound lane. Crews had to unload the semi truck before put it up right. It was filled with non-perishables.

Meanwhile, secondary and neighborhood roads are still looking rough. You'll need to add plenty of time to your commute if you plan to get out Friday. Some side streets are still covered in ice and snow. If you do have to go out, take it slow.Be mindful, even though interstates look clear, there is till the potential for black ice.

Tennessee Department of Transportation crews were out on I-24 early Friday morning patches potholes. Now multiple potholes are popping up.
