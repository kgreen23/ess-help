MOORHEAD, MINN. (KFGO) – In the midst of Thursday night’s winter storm, Moorhead firefighters responded to a car on fire that was stuck in the snow on the railroad tracks at the crossing near the intersection of 8th Street and First Avenue North, about three blocks from the main fire station

Acting Fire Captain Bert McDoungh tells KFGO News the driver was already out of the car and fire crews were able to quickly knock down the fire in the engine compartment.

McDonough says BNSF Railway was notified immediately to make sure no train was headed toward the crossing which is downtown. Once the fire was out, firefighters pushed the disabled car off the tracks.

The cause of the fire is uncertain but McDonough says it’s possible the car engine may have overheated driving through the deep snow.
