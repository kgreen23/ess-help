According to police, the wreck began when a mattress fell out of pickup truck traveling north just before the Buffington Road overpass. The driver of the truck stopped on the side of the interstate to remove the mattress from the roadway, South Fulton police spokesman Lt. Derrick Rogers said. A tractor-trailer saw what was happening and managed to stop in time. A second semitruck was unable to stop, however, and hit the back of the truck in front of it, causing the driver to lose control.The first truck lost its load of water all over the interstate while the second jackknifed and caught fire, authorities said. One driver was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital with minor injuries. Georgia Department of Transportation cameras showed plastic debris scattered all over the highway.
