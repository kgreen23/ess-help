title: "Vehicle goes in Locke Lake in 6-vehicle crash on I-94"
---
According to the State Patrol, the 2015 Lincoln MKX driven by Gary Olson, 56 of St. Cloud, slowed suddenly to stop in the right shoulder of I-94 and was hit by a 1999 Freightliner tractor driven by 27-year-old Lance Liedman of Moorhead. The impact sent the Olson vehicle into Locke Lake. Olson was taken to St. Cloud Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The Liedman semi then collided with the Duncan semi. Then a 2008 Mazda 4-door veered toward the left median, but not before striking the rear of the Liedman semi.

Also stopped on I-94 in the middle of the fracas was a new vehicle transport, which was fully loaded with trucks and appeared to have jack-knifed.

The Wright County Sheriffâ€™s Office, CentraCare Ambulance and the Monticello Fire Department assisted at the scene.
