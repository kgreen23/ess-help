HENRIETTA TOWNSHIP, Ohio — A tow truck driver and the driver of a disabled vehicle both were killed late Tuesday night when they were hit by a pickup truck while on the side of the Ohio Turnpike, according to the State Highway Patrol.

Eric Ackerman, 42, of Sandusky, who was driving a tow truck from Interstate Towing of Norwalk, was pronounced dead at the scene, a news release from the Milan post of the Highway Patrol says. The driver of the disabled vehicle also died at the scene, but troopers did not release an identity pending notification of family members.

The crash occurred at about 11:23 p.m., with the tow truck and disabled vehicle on the right shoulder of the eastbound lanes of the turnpike, troopers say. Ackerman was helping the other driver load two Sea-Doo watercraft from the trailer of the disabled vehicle onto the tow truck when they were hit by a 2009 Chevrolet 2500 pickup.

The pickup truck hit the tow truck and trailer, becoming airborne and landing on its top in the right lane of turnpike, troopers say. Ackerman was wearing a reflective vest and the overhead emergency lights on his truck were on with the crash occurred, according to troopers.

The driver of the pickup truck, a 30-year-old Bellevue resident, was treated at Mercy Health Hospital in Lorain for minor injuries, troopers say. It’s unknown if drugs or alcohol were factors. The crash remains under investigation.
