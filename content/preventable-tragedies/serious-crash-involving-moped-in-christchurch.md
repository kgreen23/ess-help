A moped rider has serious injuries after crashing into a broken-down vehicle on a Christchurch motorway.

Emergency services were called to the crash on the Southern Motorway towards Hornby, about 6.40am on Monday, a police spokeswoman said.
The moped, or motorised scooter, collided with an unoccupied broken-down vehicle on the side of the motorway, near the Annex Rd underpass, police said.
One person had serious injuries and was being taken to Christchurch Hospital, a St John spokesman said.
