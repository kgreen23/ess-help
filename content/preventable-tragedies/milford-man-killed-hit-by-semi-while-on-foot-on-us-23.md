title: "Milford Man Killed, Hit By Semi While On Foot On US 23"
---
(WWJ) A Milford man has died after he was hit by a semi truck while on foot on U.S. 23, north of Brighton.

According to the Livingston County Sheriff's Office, the 41-year-old man got out of his car just after 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, and was struck by a Kenworth semi-tractor trailer near Crouse Road, south of Clyde Road in Hartland Township.
He was pronounced dead by EMS at the scene. 

The semi driver wasn't hurt, authorities said, and speed or alcohol do not appear to have been a factor.

It's unclear at this time why the man had pulled over, although the investigation is ongoing. 

The man's name is not being released at this time. 

Southbound U.S. 23 was closed for around four hours following the incident, but has since reopened to traffic. 

Police remind drivers never to get out of their vehicles on the freeway.
