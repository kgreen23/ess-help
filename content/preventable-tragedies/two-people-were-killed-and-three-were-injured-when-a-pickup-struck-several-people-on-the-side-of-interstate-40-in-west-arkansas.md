Two people were killed and three were injured when a pickup struck several people on the side of Interstate 40 in west Arkansas on Wednesday, according to a state police report.

The crash happened about 12:30 p.m. near Mulberry in Franklin County, according to the report. People in two vehicles had stopped to help after a Ford Focus on the westbound shoulder was involved in a crash, the report states.

Troopers said a westbound Chevrolet Avalanche left the interstate and struck the Ford, pushing it into the four people who had stopped to help.

William Burrow, 59, of Bald Knob and Jesse Lowrey, 39, of Copan, Okla., died as a result of the wreck, the report states.

Clint Jones, 39, of Dewey, Okla.; Clarissa Hobbs, 38, of Fort Eustis, Va., and the driver of the Ford, 56-year-old Wanda Sarver of Whitley City, Ky., were injured.
