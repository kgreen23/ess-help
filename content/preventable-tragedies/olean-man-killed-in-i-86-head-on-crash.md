Earlier Wednesday, deputies were summoned to a two-vehicle crash on I-86 near Salamanca that resulted in serious injuries.

An investigation found that a man driving a pick-up truck struck the rear of a vehicle stopped on the eastbound shoulder due to possible mechanical issues. Four Buffalo-area men were inside the vehicle at the time of the collision.

The driver of the pick-up was taken by ambulance to Olean General Hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The driver and a passenger were taken by helicopter to Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo with serious injuries. Two other passengers were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Deputies were assisted by the New York State Police, park police, Salamanca firefighters, Seneca Nation fire and EMS, Randolph firefighters, East Randolph and Mercy Flight.
